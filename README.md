# Ecommerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project of E-commerce sales data to provide key insights on sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior across global markets. The goal is to assist stakeholders in understanding product trends, market performance, and year-over-year comparisons.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Sales_Data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- Tableau - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
Data loading and inspection.
Handling missing values.
Data Cleaning and formatting.

### Dashboard feature

- **KPIs:** Sales, Profit, Order Quantity
- **Category Analysis:** YTD vs PYTD with Sales Margin color indicators
- **Market Share:** Regional breakdown of sales
- **Customer Acquisition:** Monthly trend by region
- **Interactive Filters:** Market and Customer Segment

### Result

- Sales Growth: Overall sales reached $14.11M, showing a 5.04% increase compared to the previous year. This suggests healthy growth in customer demand.
- Profit Slightly Declined: Despite higher sales, profit dropped by 0.46%, indicating increased costs or reduced margins in certain categories.
- Order Quantity Increased Significantly: The number of orders rose by 15.02%, showing improved customer acquisition or repeat purchases.
- Strong Market Performance in LATAM and Europe:
  - LATAM contributed the highest share of sales (45.86%)
  - Europe followed with 43.37% – together dominating global performance
- Top Performing Categories:
   - Camping & Hiking and Water Sports categories outperformed previous year sales by 12.55% and 21.10%, respectively.
- Declining Categories:
   - Men’s Footwear, Indoor/Outdoor Games, and Cleats saw a 25%+ drop in sales compared to the previous year.
- Customer Acquisition Trend:
   - The monthly customer acquisition chart reveals shifts in market position, with certain regions leading acquisition efforts consistently across months.
 
### Recommendations

- Focus on High-Performing Categories: Allocate more marketing and inventory resources to growing categories like Camping & Hiking and Water Sports to capitalize on rising demand.
- Investigate Declining Categories: Analyze low-performing segments to identify issues such as pricing, competition, or customer interest and take corrective actions.
- Improve Profit Margins: Review cost structures and optimize pricing strategies to ensure profit growth aligns with sales increases.
- Leverage Strong Markets: Continue investing in high-performing regions like LATAM and Europe, while exploring ways to boost performance in underperforming markets.

### Limitations

- Data Recency: The dashboard uses historical data which may not reflect current market trends or external factors like seasonality or global events.
- Lack of Customer-Level Insights: The analysis is based on aggregated sales data; deeper insights like customer lifetime value or churn rates are not covered.
- No Cost Breakdown: Profit analysis lacks detailed cost components (e.g., shipping, marketing, discounts), which limits the depth of profitability insights.
- Limited Interactivity for End-Users: As a static dashboard screenshot or published view, some dynamic filtering or drill-down capabilities may be restricted depending on how it's shared.
